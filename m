I think that makes sense for the platforms with that problem. I'm not
sure there are many that can't do it for mmio at least. 486SX can't do it
and I guess some ARM32 but I think almost everyone else can including
most 32bit x86.

What's more of a problem is a lot of platforms can do 64bit MMIO via
ioread/write64 but not 64bit port I/O, and it's not clear how you
represent that via an ioread/write API that abstracts it away.
