I would be satisfied.

Thanks for clearing that up.  Now I understand, each port has its own =
independent set of mask bits.  So, while the doorbell numbers are =
assigned globally, the registers themselves are per port.  For the mask =
bits, the mask behavior only affects the local port.

Alright.  I'll leave it to you to find and reconcile common =
functionalities of the drivers.  What about making spad emulation =
optional?

There was a comment on irc.oftc.net #ntb wishing for patch v2 to be =
fewer patches.  Something like, 1/2: prep the existing switch driver, =
2/2: introduce the ntb driver.
