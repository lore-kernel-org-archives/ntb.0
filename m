The problem is that there will be two seperate modifications for the low
and high word. Several ways how the compiler can translate this, but the
problem is the same for all of them:

CPU 0                           CPU 1
        load low
        load high
        add  low, 1
        addc high, 0            
        store low               load high
--> NMI                         load low
                                load high and compare
        store high

You can't catch that. If this really becomes an issue you need a
sequence counter around it.

Right.

Sure, will fix.

Several reasons:

    1) The compiler can pretty much do what it wants with cnt++
       including tearing and whatever. https://lwn.net/Articles/816850/
       for the full set of insanities.

       Not really a problem here, but

    2) It's annotating the reader and the writer side and documenting
       that this is subject to concurrency

    3) It will prevent KCSAN to complain about the data race,
       i.e. concurrent modification while reading.

Indeed.
