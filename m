Now I see what you were suggesting. The solution you propose doesn't require
any changes in your patches, but requires to update IDT driver. It also
makes a change in the ports numbering semantics, which you said you
didn't want to introduce.
(read all further comments to get my conclusion regarding it)

If you don't want to add a large semantic and infrastructure change at
this point, then it would be better to leave NTB port API the way it is
now, and use logical port indexes in the ntb_peer_resource_idx() method.
You'd also need to use this method to access both outbound and inbound
memory windows. In this case we wouldn't need to change anything in
current API and drivers. Yes, this approach would cause one resource being
wasted, but it would lead to simpler semantic of the port numbers API.

Don't get me wrong. I am not completely against the approach you suggest.
It just has its pros and cons. The same way as mine does. I'll explain my
opinion later in this email.

Sorry man, but how could you base your interpretation on a code, which didn't
support multi-port case in the first place and just couldn't provide you a full
impression by definition? You knew ntb_transport doesn't support the multi-port
NTB devices, right? Moreover as far as I remember we already concerned similar
problem in a discussion of your patches submitted for ntb_pingpong driver.
You knew ntb_pingpong and ntb_perf driver support multi-port devices.
So you could get your interpretation from there.

BTW I didn't figure out it at that time, but you could fix the ntb_pingpong
driver just by replacing the strict inequality in the conditional statement:
--- a/drivers/ntb/test/ntb_pingpong.c
+++ b/drivers/ntb/test/ntb_pingpong.c
@@ -299,7 +299,7 @@ static void pp_init_flds(struct pp_ctx *pp)
        lport = ntb_port_number(pp->ntb);
        pcnt = ntb_peer_port_count(pp->ntb);
        for (pidx = 0; pidx < pcnt; pidx++) {
-               if (lport < ntb_peer_port_number(pp->ntb, pidx))
+               if (lport <= ntb_peer_port_number(pp->ntb, pidx))
                        break;
        }

This loop just finds out the logical index (as you named it) of the local port,
which then is used to select a doorbell bit from the shared doorbell register.
The similar algo is used in the ntb_perf driver.

Ah, I misunderstood your statement. I thought you implied the other way around.
I disagree then. Client drivers should be somehow able to retrieve the real physical port
number. Physical port numbers can be connected with some ports-specific functionality
(and they are in our projects), so they are used to enable/disable corresponding
code of the client drivers.

Additionally IDT PCIe NTB functions can be disabled/enabled by the device firmware,
so one device may have for instance ports 2 4 6 with NTB, while another - ports 2 6 12,
and so on. Both of these ports-set would be mapped to the same logical indexes space -
0 1 2. In case of having just the logical indexes, the code would have an impression
of working with the same hardware, while in fact it isn't.

You said: "Part of the reason we have this confusing mess is because the API was
reviewed and merged before any users of the API were presented. Usually this is not
accepted in kernel development." A source code of my project is using current port
API and happy with it, so there was at least one user of the API at the time of
the API submission. I bet there are others now, since I constantly get private questions
regarding the IDT hardware configurations. So please don't be so judgemental. If you see
some confusing from your point of view things it doesn't always mean it is a mess,
you just may misunderstand something. I am sure a pro with experience like yours
doesn't need this to be explained.

To sum the discussion up we now have two possible solutions of the problem
discovered in this patch:

1) Leave current NTB port API as is, but fix this patch so the ntb_peer_resource_idx()
method would return a port logical index:
Physical port numbers: 0 2 4 6 8 12 16 20 (ntb_peer_port_number()/ntb_port_number())
Logical port numbers:  0 1 2 3 4  5  6  7 (ntb_peer_resource_idx())
Port indexes (Port 0): x 0 1 2 3  4  5  6 (ntb_peer_port_idx())
Port indexes (Port 8): 0 1 2 3 x  4  5  6 (ntb_peer_port_idx())
+ pros:
  no need to change current NTB port API and available drivers;
  no need to apply the gap-less limitation on the NTB port numbers sequence;
- cons:
  use ntb_peer_resource_idx() method to distribute a shared resource on each side
of NTB (although it might be neutral or pros from some point of view);
  waste one memory window (no problem with shared doorbell register).

2) Apply the gap-less limitation on the NTB port numbers sequence, so the
ntb_peer_port_number()/ntb_port_number() would return the logical port index:
Physical port numbers: 0 2 4 6 8 12 16 20 (no NTB API method to get these numbers)
Logical port numbers:  0 1 2 3 4  5  6  7 (ntb_peer_port_number()/ntb_port_number())
Port indexes (Port 0): x 0 1 2 3  4  5  6 (ntb_peer_port_idx())
Port indexes (Port 8): 0 1 2 3 x  4  5  6 (ntb_peer_port_idx())
+ pros:
  no waste of one memory window;
  use port numbers returned from ntb_peer_port_number()//ntb_port_number()
to distribute doorbell bits and outbound MWs;
  use ntb_peer_resource_idx() just at the peer side to select a proper inbound MW;
- cons:
  need to change the port-index callbacks of the IDT hardware driver;
  introduces a change in the port numbers semantic;
  NTB port API gets to be an abstraction over the real physical port numbers,
while the later ones won't de directly available to retrieve.


The rest of the solutions would lead to overcomplications in the NTB port API,
which we don't want to introduce.

Personally after all the considerations I am now more inclined to the (2)-nd
solution. Even though it causes more changes and makes the ports API
more abstract, it provides a way to create a simpler shared resources
distribution code as well as to exactly distribute the necessary number
of memory windows. While the physical port number still can be found by
client drivers directly from pci_dev descriptor.

The final decision regarding the solution is after the subsystem maintainers.
But although the provided by this patchset NTB MSI library consists some part
with multi-port API utilization like MWs distribution, as I said in comments
to the other patches, it doesn't really support the only multi-ports NTB device
currently available - IDT (which I only interested in). So I don't see a reason
why I should bother with providing a patch with alterations to the IDT hardware
driver unless this patchset provides a portable NTB MSI library.
