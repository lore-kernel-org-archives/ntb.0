For the drivers/pci changes:

Acked-by: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas@google.com>

A few trivial nits:

The subject lines and changelogs are inconsistent in ntb/NTB, api/API,
switchtec/Switchtec, idb/IDB, db/DB, etc.  My personal preference is
to capitalize acronyms and initialisms in English text.

I think it also makes the text easier to read when function names have
"()" after them, e.g., peer_mw_trans() vs peer_mw_trans.

"This patch adds ..." is superfluous; "Add ..." would be sufficient,
given the context.
