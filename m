This is just a resend. I haven't recieved any additional feedback in a number
of version and the patchset has been around for a couple kernel cycles.
It would be nice if someone would take a look at getting this merged.

This cleanup was originally requested by Greg after he reviewed my
Switchtec NTB code.

Thanks,

Logan

This is v9 of my cleanup series to push a number of instances of people
defining their own io{read|write}64 functions into common headers seing
they don't exist in non-64bit systems. This series adds inline functions to the
io-64-nonatomic headers and then cleans up the drivers that defined their
own.

Changes since v8:
- Rebased onto v4.15-rc2, as a result rewrote patch 7 seeing someone did
  some similar cleanup in that area.
- Added a patch to clean up the Switchtec NTB driver which landed in
  v4.15-rc1

Changes since v7:
- Fix minor nits from Andy Shevchenko
- Rebased onto v4.14-rc1

Changes since v6:
 ** none **

Changes since v5:
- Added a fix to the tilcdc driver to ensure it doesn't use the
  non-atomic operation. (This includes adding io{read|write}64[be]_is_nonatomic
  defines).

Changes since v4:
- Add functions so the powerpc implementation of iomap.c compiles. (As
  noticed by Horia)

Changes since v3:

- I noticed powerpc didn't use the appropriate functions seeing
  readq/writeq were not defined when iomap.h was included. Thus I've
  included a patch to adjust this
- Fixed some mistakes with a couple of the defines in io-64-nonatomic*
  headers
- Fixed a typo noticed by Horia.

(earlier versions were drastically different)

Logan Gunthorpe (8):
  drm/tilcdc: ensure nonatomic iowrite64 is not used
  powerpc: io.h: move iomap.h include so that it can use readq/writeq
    defs
  powerpc: iomap.c: introduce io{read|write}64_{lo_hi|hi_lo}
  iomap: introduce io{read|write}64_{lo_hi|hi_lo}
  io-64-nonatomic: add io{read|write}64[be]{_lo_hi|_hi_lo} macros
  ntb: ntb_hw_intel: use io-64-nonatomic instead of in-driver hacks
  crypto: caam: cleanup CONFIG_64BIT ifdefs when using io{read|write}64
  ntb: ntb_hw_switchtec: Cleanup 64bit IO defines to use the common
    header
