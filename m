Drivers that want a non-atomic variant should include either
include/linux/io-64-nonatomic-hi-lo.h or include/linux/io-64-nonatomic-lo-hi.h
depending on what they need. Drivers that require 64-bit I/O should
probably just depend on CONFIG_64BIT and maybe use readq/writeq.

I see that there are exactly two drivers calling ioread64/iowrite64:
drivers/crypto/caam/ is architecture specific and
drivers/ntb/hw/intel/ntb_hw_intel.c already has a workaround that should
make it build on alpha.
