right, PCIe can have upto 8 functions. So the issues with the current framework
has to be fixed. I don't expect major obstacles with this as of now.

right. I felt pci_endpoint_test is the generic function that would be of
interest to all the vendors. Any new function can be added by taking
pci_endpoint_test as a reference.

The simple usecase I plan to work on after completing the framework is to have
a camera sensor in one board and display in another board (the boards connected
using PCIe) and the display showing the the camera capture.

Okay. So here the main function (actual PCI function) *can* perform the work of
virtio muliplexer if the platform wants to support sub-functions or it can be a
normal PCI function. right?

Do you mean the virtio should actually be in the host side? Even here the
system that implements PCI function should have multiple functions right? (one
for network, other for console etc..). So there should be a virtio multiplexer
both in the host side and in the device side?

hmm.. okay.
