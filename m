After a long-ish conversation on IRC, the way we want to go forward
would be to provide 2 ways of communicating prior to the MW's being
setup:  SPADs and Message Registers.  The HW driver would make
available whichever ones are supported by the hardware.  The transport
can see which of those are available in the HW driver, select the
appropriate one, and use it to setup the NTB connection, MW, etc.
similar to how the SPADs are being used today.  This would allow for
any current clients to work unmodified, and would require minimal
changes to the existing transport layer.

Since this is outside the scope of this series, per my email yesterday
allowing the SPAD workaround, we should start up another thread on the
NTB mailing list and flesh out the details and any benefits/drawbacks.
Then we, as a community, can make the changes necessary to the drivers
and transport to get this working more optimally.

Thanks,
Jon
