That implies that this needs to be fixed, no driver should ever have to
define this themselves.  The fact that they all do it at the same time
is a huge hint that it's wrong.

I suggest coming up with something simple like what you have here,
adding it to the arch-generic code and posting it to the linux-arch
mailing list and seeing if anyone screams :)
