Why do you think that the current code with DOMAIN_BUS_PLATFORM_MSI is
designware EPC specific?

I don't see anything that is designware EPC specific.

Sure, it relies on GIC ITS, but I don't see why non-designware EPCs can't
use GIC ITS.

I also wanted to use my designware based EPC for doorbells in nvmet-pci-epf,
specifically the support that Koichiro added for inbound subrange mapping.

However, most designware EPC have a strict alignment requirement
(CX_ATU_MIN_REGION_SIZE), which is often 4k.

This alignment requirement is there both on the PCI address (address within
the BAR, and for the physical memory address (target address)).

I thought that we could use the inbound subrange mapping and put the doorbells
in a separate inbound iATU, so we could remove polling in the nvmet-pci-epf
driver, just like they have done in the vNTB driver. However, it works in vNTB
because they have a register telling exactly which BAR and offset in that BAR
where the doorbells are.
In the NVMe PCIe Transport specification, the offset for the start of the
doorbells is fixed, at offset 0x1000 (4k) and the only thing you can change is
the stride between the doorbells.

Currently, a doorbell is a single 32-bit data, sure we could call
pci_epf_alloc_doorbell() with ("number of I/O queues" + 1 (admin queue)) * 2
(submission queue and completion queue).

However, the address which we get from pci_epf_alloc_doorbell() might not be
4k aligned.

We have the function pci_epf_align_inbound_addr() which can split this
non-aligned address to a 4k aligned base + offset from that base.

However, that would also require the host side driver to write to this offset
from the start address. (See e.g. doorbell_offset in pci-epf-test.c).

So, basically, with the current limitation that the doorbells must start at
0x1000, together with the fact that the doorbells returned from
pci_epf_alloc_doorbell() might have an arbitrary alignment, I don't see how
we could add support for doorbells in nvmet-pci-epf.

If we could supply an alignment requirement to pci_epf_alloc_doorbell(),
e.g. 4k, and the API is guaranteed to return an address that satisfies this
alignment requirement, then we would be good.

However, right now, we don't have such an API. We simple get an address
somewhere within the GIC ITS MMIO region.

Sounds like a good idea.

I have looked at adding doorbell support to nvmet-pci-epf, but got stuck on
pci_epf_alloc_doorbell() returning an address that is not 4k aligned.

(Since the NVMe PCIe transport specification has the doorbells at a fixed
location, we can't change that.)

But if we could provide an "alignment" parameter to pci_epf_alloc_doorbell(),
then I think it is possible.

Sure, the GIC ITS MMIO area might be quite small, so it might not be able
satisfy such a request. E.g. on rk3588, the its1 MMIO region is 0x20000 (128k):
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v7.1-rc1/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3588-base.dtsi#L2414

However, I have not idea of how much of this region the GIC driver uses for
actual registers, and how much of that region it can actually dedicate to
doorbells.


Kind regards,
Niklas
