This is a really really bad idea as per the Alpha comment.

ioread64 and iowrite64 generate a single 64bit bus transaction. There is
hardware where mmio operations have side effects so simply using a pair
of 32bit operations blindly does not work (consider something as trivial
as reading a 64bit performance counter or incrementing pointer).

If a platform doesn't support 64bit I/O operations from the CPU then you
either need to use some kind of platform/architecture specific interface
if present or accept you don't have one.

It's not safe to split it. Possibly for some use cases you could add an

ioread64_maysplit()

but you cannot blindly break ioread64/write64() and expect it to
magically allow you to use drivers that depend upon it.

What btw is the actual ARM compiler warning ? Is the compiler also trying
to tell you it's a bad idea ?
