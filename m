Dear Bjorn,

Logan answered the questions quite thoroughly. (Thanks, Logan!)


Don't initialize variables unless there's a path through the
code that would otherwise use an uninitialized value.

No blank line here.

Use "pci_err(pdev, ...)" here and below.
[...]
I think you should probably disable the device here (and in the error
return path) to balance the enable above.

I'll make the changes (above) that you requested.

Blessings,
Doug
