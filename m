I don't think this has anything to do with inbound vs outbound. The
problem is the same no matter from which direction you assign things.

Well my solution wasn't to change pidx and no, we don't want to change
ntb_peer_resource_idx() to return the logical port number because that's
not how it's being used and I have no use for a
ntb_peer_port_global_idx() function. Functions are supposed to be added
by code that needs to call them, not by some grand design. Part of the
reason we have this confusing mess is because the API was reviewed and
merged before any users of the API were presented. Usually this is not
accepted in kernel development.

My suggestion is to simply say that the existing port numbers are the
logical port number and have the drivers handle the physical port number
mapping internally. That requires the fewest changes.

That define would not be useful.

Again, I'd rather not add a bunch of large semantic and infrastructure
changes at this point. It's confusing enough as it is and we don't need
to introduce yet another indexing scheme API to the clients that really
do not need it. What the clients need is a simple API to decide which
resources to use for which peers, and to figure out which peers used
which resources. ntb_peer_port_idx() and ntb_peer_resource_idx() suit
these purposes. Nothing else really needs to exist.

I think that's up for interpretation as, based on the existing code, I
naturally interpreted it the other way and therefore it's pretty simple
to say that it's the logical port number and fix the one driver that
needs to change.

My interpretation of the port-index was simply to match what was done in
the two port case seeing code like ntb_transport simply uses the default
0 as the port index. There was no reason to believe, based on the code,
that there would be gaps.

Huh? How can you say you absolutely agree with me? I said the clients
should not need to know about physical port numbers and you said the
physical port numbers *must* be available to clients. I think this
statement needs to be justified. Why should the clients need to know
about the physical port numbers?

To me, it seems like the port indexes are used everywhere. A client
almost always wants to deal with every port except itself. That seems
entirely natural to me. Using the port index as the resource index makes
perfect sense (which is why I implemented the inverse
ntb_peer_resource_idx()).

Drivers don't care about port indexes or how the resources are
distributed. I would expect that all they'd do is map the port index
(which all existing APIs take) to the physical address and program
hardware as necessary.

No, from the perspective of the client, the physical port numbers are
useless. I don't want the count to include the local one because that
means I'd always have to subtract one every time I want to loop through
all peers (I never want to loop through all ports including the local
one).  I have no idea what your distinction between logical (global)
index and logical port index is. In fact I find this all confusing.

What we currently have all makes perfect sense to me and is exactly what
I want for the clients, except I think ntb_port_number() needs to be the
logical port number (with the gaps removed), so that we can more easily
implement ntb_peer_resource_idx(). If ntb_port_number() corresponds to
the physical port number, then the correct implementation of
ntb_peer_resource_idx() is going to be crazy, essentially needing to
generate a logical port number for every port, every time it's called.
