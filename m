No, Doug tried it in the driver first and it didn't work. The symbol is
also not exported which was probably done because it can't be used in
the driver.

Digging into the code a bit, it's not because it must be done by the
Host OS but because it must be done before the IOMMU groups are created.
The IOMMU code registers a bus_notifier and creates the groups based on
the dma_alias mask when it receives the BUS_NOTIFY_ADD_DEVICE event.
This event is notified in device_add() just before a call to
bus_probe_device()[1]. Therefore, if a driver attempts to use
pci_add_dma_alias() as part of it's probe routine, it will be too late
as the IOMMU has already setup the groups based on the original version
of the dma_alias_mask.

I suspect this is by design as the groups must be created before and any
dma_maps are done on the device and some drivers may create dma_maps
during probe.
