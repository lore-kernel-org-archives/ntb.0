container_from() or from_container(), either works just fine for me
in terms of naming.

I think people are hating on it because it makes for _really_ long
lines, and it's arguably cleaner/simpler to just pass in the pointer
type instead. Then you end up with lines like this:

	struct request_queue *q =                                               
		container_of(work, struct request_queue, requeue_work.work);  

But I'm not the one that started this addition of from_tasklet(), my
objection was adding a private macro for something that should be
generic functionality. Hence I think we either need to provide that, or
tell the from_tasklet() folks that they should just use container_of().
