I wouldn't expect it to matter: the byte swap is almost always much
cheaper compared to the actual bus access for the MMIO, and I
would also guess that modern compilers can eliminate the double
byte swap on architectures where writel() is an inline function. Most of
the important architectures use ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP, which
guarantees that.
