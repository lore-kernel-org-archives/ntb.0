Patches 5..16:

Acked-by: Allen Hubbe <Allen.Hubbe@dell.com>

Should the order of 6 and 7 be swapped?



While I still have some objections to this series, we have already been =
over them, and I won't let these stand in the way:

6 - I think just the comment is best.  Rather than prohibit the use of =
functionality for hardware that does support the calls, in my opinion it =
should be left to specific hardware drivers to return an error.

14 - I would prefer that a non-hardware-supported implementation of =
spads via a memory window should be common code, not reinvented in each =
specific hardware driver that lacks hardware spads.  You pointed out =
that the spads implemented here use the shared_mw construct, which is =
specific to this driver.  I am concerned that spads in the shared_mw =
(really anything in shared_mw, including this driver's indication of the =
peer link state) limits the applicability of this driver to just =
configurations of two ntb ports.  You stated this limitation upfront.

> The Switchtec hardware supports doorbells, memory windows and =
messages.
> Seeing there is no native scratchpad support, 128 spads are emulated
> through the use of a pre-setup memory window. The switch has 64
> doorbells which are shared between the two partitions and a

> than 2 partitions, this driver only supports the first two seeing
> the current NTB API only supports two hosts.
>=20
> The driver has been tested with ntb_netdev and fully passes the

>=20
> Logan Gunthorpe (16):

>   ntb: ensure ntb_mw_get_align() is only called when the link is up
>   ntb: add check and comment for link up to mw_count() and
>     mw_get_align()
>   ntb: ntb_test: ensure the link is up before trying to configure the
