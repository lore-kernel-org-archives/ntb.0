I applied these with Logan's reviewed-by to my pci/switchtec branch for
v4.19 with the following updates:

  - You removed the SPDX tag from drivers/pci/switch/switchtec.c.  I assume
    that was a mistake, so I restored it.

  - I moved the PCI_VENDOR_ID_MICROSEMI definition to keep the file sorted.

  - I dropped the Device ID definitions per the policy at the top of the
    file (which I mentioned on your v1 posting).

  - I converted all the Device ID definition uses to raw hex constants.  I
    noticed that the following were defined by your patch, but not used:

      PCI_DEVICE_ID_MICROSEMI_PSX24XG3
      PCI_DEVICE_ID_MICROSEMI_PSX32XG3

    I can't tell whether the quirk is supposed to apply to them or not.

Please review and holler if I broke something.

This touches drivers/ntb/hw/..., which isn't my area.  Let me know if you'd
rather take these through a different tree.
