Just more philosophy. You haven't given any good reason to remove the
functionality. Vague references to the way things were created aren't
compelling arguments. Better to cite code and point out actual problems.

Ok, well when all the NTB clients no longer require using scratchpads
and we can all abide by the rule that clients must function without
them. Then, I'll remove the emulation. Until then, it stays.

You should probably read that again because it doesn't actually support
your point (in fact it's saying something quite unrelated). It is also
probably a good idea to read the rest of the seciton you cite:

"The idea here is that you should break changes up in such a way that it
will be easy to review."

"When creating a new feature patchset, you may need to break up your
changes into multiple commits. "

"Clean up patches that are over 200 lines long are discouraged, because
they are hard to review. Break those patches up into smaller patches. "

Also, to quote Greg Kroah-Hartman from my last series[1]:

"That's one big patch to review, would you want to do that?

Can you break it up into smaller parts?"

Well you're free to think that but, in my experience, your opinion
differs significantly from the rest of the kernel community which I
personally agree with.

Now, if you'd like to actually review the code I'd be happy to address
any concerns you find. I won't be responding to any more philosophical
arguments or bike-shedding over the format of the patch.
