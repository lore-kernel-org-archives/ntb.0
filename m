Thought a bit on how to implement this and felt we should have the following
entities:-
	* Function (or main function)
	* sub-Function
	* device

Function: a single PCI function (as defined in the PCI specification with a
separate configuration space). It will have control over the PCI header, manage
BAR's and interrupts. It may or may not have sub-functions (sub-functions can
be one or many).
	Managing BAR's: The sub-functions will not have information
			about BAR's. It will just request the number of
			address space it requires to the main *function*. The
			main function will allocate one BAR for each such
			request based on the BAR availability.

	Managing interrupts:
		FOR MSI: Say each main function is capable of supporting 32 MSI
			 interrupts. Each sub-function can request 'n' number
			 of interrupts. (The sub-function will not be aware of
			 the MSI number allocated to it). For each
			 sub-function the interrupts will be numbered from
			 '1..n'. The main function will map the sub-function
			 interrupt to MSI interrupt number.

		For legacy: No management is required, since one interrupt
			    line will be shared by all sub-functions. The host
			    driver will check the interrupt status register.

Is there any thing else that has to be managed by the main Function?

Here the framework should be modified to add a new interface between the
sub-function and main Function. A *simple* main Function should also be added
to manage only the BARs and interrupts. For any special use case, new main
Function has to be created.
The host side driver for this main function will be bound to it using the
existing PCI host side mechanism. (using device id/vendor id/class code etc..).

sub-Function: Not defined in PCI specification. It will be *part* of the main
function. There can be one or more sub-function within a main function. Each
sub-function within a main function will be independent of each other.
It will request the number of local address space required and the number of
MSI interrupts from the main function.
Each sub-function should have a separate host side driver. But how do we bind
the host side driver with the sub-function? Here the existing host side PCI
framework won't work.

Some options for binding sub-function to it's host side driver:
Have a separate vendor-id/product id for each sub function. (But the *pci_dev*
for the sub-function will not be created by host side PCI framework. The PCI
framework shouldn't also have to do it because this is not standard).

The main *function* driver will scan the list of it's sub-functions (We can
make the 1st BAR to be used by main *Function* and have these informations
there.) and for each function it creates a new *pci_dev* allocating the memory
resources. This way the sub-function host side driver can be created just like
a regular PCI driver. I'm not sure if creating a pci_dev from a pci driver will
have any adverse effects.

The other option is to define a new type of device (say pci_func_dev) and make
the main *function* driver create these devices when it is getting probed. For
binding, we can maybe just use a compatible string populated by the
sub-function driver when it registers with the main function driver. Since this
doesn't use an existing data structure, this should not be very difficult to
implement.

With either options, lspci won't list any sub-functions.

device: one or more function (main function) will constitute a device. This
shouldn't be too difficult to implement.

I think most of the complexity lies in the design of sub-function. Please let
me know your thoughts and other ideas.

Thanks
Kishon
