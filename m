Alright!

In code review, I really only have found minor nits.  Overall, the =
driver looks good.

In switchtec_ntb_part_op, there is a delay of up to 50s (1000 * 50ms).  =
This looks like a thread context, so it could involve the scheduler for =
the delay instead of spinning for up to 50s before bailing.

There are a few instances like this:
> +	dev_dbg(&stdev->dev, "%s\n", __func__);

Where the printing of __func__ could be controlled by dyndbg=3D+pf.  The =
debug message could be more useful.

In switchtec_ntb_db_set_mask and friends, an in-memory copy of the mask =
bits is protected by a spinlock.  Elsewhere, you noted that the db bits =
are shared between all ports, so the db bitset is chopped up to be =
shared between the ports.  Is the db mask also shared, and how is the =
spinlock sufficient for synchronizing access to the mask bits between =
multiple ports?

The IDT switch also does not have hardware scratchpads.  Could the code =
you wrote for emulated scratchpads be made into shared library code for =
ntb drivers?  Also, some ntb clients may not need scratchpad support.  =
If it is not natively supported by a driver, can the emulated scratchpad =
support be an optional feature?
