Good point - looking through the device trees I only saw the msi-map / =
platform
msi set for the imx95 and assumed designware was the only EPC supporting
this (also because the code uses that of-node specifically), but I =
indeed don=E2=80=99t see=20
a reason that other chips can=E2=80=99t use this.

I=E2=80=99m a bit confused on the configuration, fwiw it=E2=80=99s =
probably me being unfamiliar
with PCIe, but it doesn=E2=80=99t seem right to configure the MSI and =
eDMA DBs through
a kconfig option rather than inferring it from the device tree and/or =
having the EP
driver enable the capability and expose an operation to realize it.

On the other hand, that way, we would probably end up with identical DB
implementations in mutliple drivers.

Check, thanks for the write-up, this is also what I=E2=80=99m looking to =
get working,
coindicentally on the RK3588. I had imagined that it would be possible =
to build
a sufficient API by passing in a base offset and stride for the doorbell =
allocation,=20
but an alignment param sounds better. Can we program the resulting =
doorbells
at an arbitrary offset in a BAR, or would we waste the first allocated
doorbell that=E2=80=99s going to be located at 0x0000 - 0x1000?

In any case, I think it would be preferable for users of the =
alloc_doorbell function
to pass in what kind of doorbell they want instead of using a fallback =
mechanism.
It seems to me that the alignment and possibly a larger amount of =
doorbells are
possible with the eDMA doorbell mechanism. Or am I misunderstanding eDMA
here and is that bounded by mapping / size / alignment of the GIC ITS?

I=E2=80=99ll refactor my local branch and include this patchset and send =

will probably not work on this for another couple days though.

Hrm, I think I=E2=80=99m misunderstanding the eDMA mechanism that is =
proposed in this
patch. Is the fixed eDMA register block (e.g. BAR4 for the RK3588) =
translated to
a space in the GIC ITS MMIO area - or is restriction specifically on =
adding alignment
to the platform MSI doorbell implementation?
