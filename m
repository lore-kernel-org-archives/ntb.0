I think this code is of quality enough to go from an RFC to a standard
patch, and we can nit pick it to death there ;-)

Please rebase on ntb-next (which I believe you are already doing), and
resbutmit.

Also, we'll need to decide how to handle the patches to
drivers/pci/switches
We have 2 options here.
1.  We can split it up into 2 separate series, and have Bjorn take the
drivers/pci/switches in his, and I'll take the NTB portions.  The down
side of this is that I'll have to wait for his to get pulled in first,
which will push this back a full kernel release (which based on your
comment above doesn't seem your prefered choice)
2.  I can pull in the drivers/pci/switches patches into my NTB tree,
but I'll want Bjorn's ack on those patches before I'll pull them in.  

I'm thinking that we'll want to keep this series all in one place.
So, #2 sounds like the best option.  But, I need Bjorns $0.02 on this.


FYI, I ran smatch on the patches and got this.  Please correct them in
v2 (or v1 of the non-RFC...however you want to think of it).
drivers/pci/switch/switchtec.c:484 switchtec_dev_read() error: double unlock 'mutex:&stdev->mrpc_mutex'
drivers/pci/switch/switchtec.c:506 switchtec_dev_read() error: double unlock 'mutex:&stdev->mrpc_mutex'
drivers/pci/switch/switchtec.c:513 switchtec_dev_read() warn: inconsistent returns 'mutex:&stdev->mrpc_mutex'.


Thanks,
Jon
