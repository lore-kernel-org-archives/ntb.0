See what is staged in https://github.com/jonmason/ntb.git ntb-next, with =
the addition of multi-peer support by Serge.  It would be good at this =
stage to understand whether the api changes there would also support the =
Switchtec driver, and what if anything must change, or be planned to =
change, to support the Switchtec driver.

Thanks for providing the patch set for the Switchtec driver.  My first =
impression is that it is a good patch set.  Only to be included, it =
needs to be reconciled with the api changes in ntb-next.  I will follow =
up with a more detailed review of patches in this series, but sending =
this now as I don't want to delay your review of ntb-next.
