Elsewhere, you noted that the db bits are shared between all ports, so the db bitset is chopped up to be shared between the ports.  Is the db mask also shared, and how is the spinlock sufficient for synchronizing access to the mask bits between multiple ports?

It's exactly the way the IDT hardware works. There is Global doorbell
registers, directly connected to doorbell registers of each port, unless
doorbell routing isn't configured differently by global switch configuration.
Each port has got it's own in and out doorbell registers as well as the
doorbell mask preventing the corresponding doorbell bit from generating
interrupt.

Also, some ntb clients may not need scratchpad support.  If it is not natively supported by a driver, can the emulated scratchpad support be an optional feature?

Alas there are no IDT folks here. It's only me for now, who was responsible
for NTB API alteration (together with much of help from others NTB guys) and
IDT NTB driver development fitting that API.
