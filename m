Changes since v3:

- Rebased onto the Jon's ntb branch that contains one of the patches
  that was in v3
- Various spelling and commit log mistakes noticed by Bjorn
- Renamed switchtec_ntb to ntb_hw_switchtec per Dave's suggestion
- Fixed a number of code nits pointed out by Jon

--

Changes since v2:

- Reordered the ntb_test link patch per Allen
- Removed an extra call to switchtec_ntb_init_mw
- Fixed a typo in the switchtec.txt documentation.

--

Changes since v1:

- Rebased onto latest ntb-next branch (with v4.13-rc1)
- Reworked ntb_mw_count() function so that it can be called all the
  time (per discussion with Allen)
- Various spelling and formatting cleanups from Bjorn
- Added request_module() call such that the NTB module is automatically
  loaded when appropriate hardware exists.

--

Changes since the rfc:

- Rebased on ntb-next
- Switched ntb_part_op to use sleep instead of delay
- Dropped a number of useless dbg __func__ prints
- Went back to the dynamic instead of the static class
- Swapped the notifier block for a simple callback
- Modified the new ntb api so that a couple functions with pidx
  now must be called after link up. Per our discussion on the list.

This patchset implements Non-Transparent Bridge (NTB) support for the
Microsemi Switchtec series of switches. We're looking for some
review from the community at this point but hope to get it upstreamed
for v4.14.

Switchtec NTB support is configured over the same function and bar
as the management endpoint. Thus, the new driver hooks into the
management driver which we had merged in v4.12. We use the class
interface API to register an NTB device for every switchtec device
which supports NTB (not all do).

The Switchtec hardware supports doorbells, memory windows and messages.
Seeing there is no native scratchpad support, 128 spads are emulated
through the use of a pre-setup memory window. The switch has 64
doorbells which are shared between the two partitions and a
configurable set of memory windows. While the hardware supports more
than 2 partitions, this driver only supports the first two seeing
the current NTB API only supports two hosts.

The driver has been tested with ntb_netdev and fully passes the
ntb_test script.

This patchset is based off of ntb-next and can be found in this
git repo:
