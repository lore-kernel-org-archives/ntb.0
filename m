Yes, that's correct.

I'm not aware of any public specs on this. The basic idea is that a peer
accesses a BAR memory window on it's own side and the NTB translates it
to a memory request on the local side. This request has it's requester
ID translated through a LUT seeing the requester ID on the initiating
side isn't valid on the receiving side. The LUT has multiple entries so
that multiple requester IDs can be translated and the responses routed
back to the original requester.

The local side of the requester ID LUT are fixed by the hardware so we
can determine all the possible IDs coming from the NTB device just by
reading some registers. The peer's side of the LUT are programmed with
all possible source requester IDs by the driver but these don't have any
effect on the ID's on the receiving side.

We'd like it to be done in the driver too but it seems
pci_add_dma_alias() must be called before the driver is initialized and
therefore in a quirk. Presently, it seems nearly all calls to that
function are in quirks.c for this reason.

Thanks,
