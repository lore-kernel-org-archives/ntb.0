DMA_FROM_DEVICE means the device will be sending write requests to the 
address; DMA_TO_DEVICE means the device will be sending read requests to 
the address; DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL means the device might send either or 
both. Never does the *address* try to pull or push data anywhere of its 
own accord, regardless of whether it's RAM or MMIO or whatever. Hence 
why we don't have or need DMA_{TO,FROM}_MEMORY either ;)

Indeed if the endpoint controller could somehow recognise that an 
incoming write was a "doorbell" write based on the incoming BAR offset 
and internally short-circuit that to directly raise its own interrupt 
*without* propagating a transaction into the rest of the system, then it 
wouldn't need the DMA mapping. However, if it's just set up to forward 
ranges of BAR address to ranges of system addresses, and there's an 
IOMMU in that path (such that the iATU's "system addresses" at that 
point are actually IOVAs), then all that really matters is what requests 
the IOMMU is going to see coming out of the iATU, irrespective of 
whether a particular system address after translation happens to be an 
MSI controller, and that MSI controller coincidentally happens to live 
right next to the iATU itself.

(Of course the DMA API itself does also care about the general 
distinction of the target address being "memory" or "not memory", as 
implied by dma_map_page/single/sg() vs. dma_map_resource(), but that's 
mostly just for the software aspects of knowing not to attempt cache 
maintenance etc. on the "not memory" where it wouldn't be meaningful or 
valid.)

Thanks,
Robin.
