I'm not sure who should really own this file:

  $ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl -f Documentation/switchtec.txt
  Kurt Schwemmer <kurt.schwemmer@microsemi.com> (maintainer:PCI DRIVER FOR MICROSEMI SWITCHTEC)
  Logan Gunthorpe <logang@deltatee.com> (maintainer:PCI DRIVER FOR MICROSEMI SWITCHTEC)
  Jonathan Corbet <corbet@lwn.net> (maintainer:DOCUMENTATION)
  linux-pci@vger.kernel.org (open list:PCI DRIVER FOR MICROSEMI SWITCHTEC)
  linux-doc@vger.kernel.org (open list:DOCUMENTATION)
  linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (open list)

and Jon (NTB driver core maintainer) has applied recent updates
to it.

But in the interest of forward progress, I applied this patch with
Logan's ack to pci/misc for v4.20.
