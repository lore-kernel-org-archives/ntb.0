Actually IMO multi-function device in PCI should be much simpler than it is for
USB. In the case of USB, all the functions in a multi-function device will
share the same *usb configuration* . (USB device can have multiple
configuration but only one can be enabled at a time). A multi-function USB
device will still have a single vendor-id/product-id/class... So I think a
separate library (composite.c) in USB makes sense.

But in the case of PCI, every function can be treated independently since all
the functions have it's own 4KB configuration space. Each function can be
configured independently. Each can have it's own vendor-id/product-id/class..
I'm not sure if we'll need a separate library for PCI like we have for USB.

Now the restriction for not allowing multi-function device is because of the
following structure definition.

struct pci_epc {
	..
        struct pci_epf *epf;
	..
};

EPC has a single reference to EPF and it is used *only* to notify the function
driver when the link is up. (If this can be changed to use notification
mechanism, multi-function devices can be supported here)

One more place where this restriction arises is in designware driver

struct dw_pcie_ep {
	..
        u8 bar_to_atu[6];
	..
};

We use single ATU window to configure a BAR (in BAR). If there are multiple
functions, then this should also be modified since each function has 6 BARs.

This can be fixed without much effort unless some other issue props up.

The hardware I have doesn't support multiple PCI functions (like having a
separate configuration space for each function). It has a dedicated space for
configuration space supporting only one function. [Section 24.9.7.3.2
PCIe_SS_EP_CFG_DBICS Register Description in  [1]].

yeah, it has to be done in software (but that won't be multi-function device in
PCI terms).

Actually I didn't mean that. It was more with respect to the host side PCI test
driver (drivers/misc/pci_endpoint_test.c). Right now it validates BAR, irq
itself. I wanted to change this so that the user controls which tests to run.
(Like for USB gadget zero tests, testusb.c invokes ioctls to perform various
tests). Similarly I want to have a userspace program invoke pci_endpoint_test
to perform various PCI tests.

I have changed the core designware driver structures (like previously the
platform drivers will only use pcie_port, but now I introduced struct dw_pcie
to support both host and endpoint). This will break (compilation failure) all
the designware based drivers (except dra7xx). All these drivers should be
adapted to the new change (even if they work only in host mode these has to be
adapted).

Yeah, both USB gadget and PCI endpoint use configfs interface but the semantics
are quite different.

Every directory in *usb_gadget* corresponds to a gadget device, and the gadget
device has a functions sub-directory which has the USB functions. And these
directories have fields or attributes specific to USB.

But in the case of PCI, every directory in *pci_ep* corresponds to a PCI
function and it has fields or attributes specific to PCI function.

The main reason for using configfs for PCI endpoint is to give the users to
control "which function has to be bound to which controller". The same concept
is used for USB gadget as well but there it is "which gadget device has to be
bound to which controller".

These patches just do "mv drivers/pci/host  drivers/pci/controller", so I guess
irrespective of the changes in the existing driver it should just move. Anyways
I have to check this.

It would definitely be nice to select the mode at runtime. Even for this patch
series, I added a temporary dtsi patch to configure the pci controller in EP
mode (which can't be merged since the same controller is also used to test RC).
