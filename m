Subject: [PATCH v18 0/7] Add io{read|write}64 to io-64-atomic headers

This is a resend of my cleanup series to push a number of instances of
people defining their own io{read|write}64 functions into common
headers seing they don't exist in non-64bit systems. This series adds
inline functions to the io-64-nonatomic headers and then cleans up the
drivers that defined their own copies.

This cleanup was originally requested by Greg after he reviewed my
Switchtec NTB code.

@Andrew, can you please consider merging this series as it has a
number of cross-tree pieces? It has been around for a number of
cycles, has had some reviews, and a few small pieces of it have been
already accepted through various other trees.

This marks the one year aniversary since I started this series.

Thanks,

Logan

Changes since v17:
- Rebased onto v4.18-rc1 (No Changes)

Changes since v16:
- Rebased onto v4.17-rc4 (No Changes)

Changes since v15:
- Rebased onto v4.17-rc1, dropping the powerpc patches which were
  picked up by Michael

Changes since v14:
- Rebased onto v4.16-rc7
- Replace the first two patches so that instead of correcting the
  endianness annotations we change to using writeX() and readX() with
  swabX() calls. This makes the big-endian functions more symmetric
  with the little-endian versions (with respect to barriers that are
  not included in the raw functions). As a side effect, it also fixes
  the kbuild warnings that the first two patches tried to address.

Changes since v13:
- Changed the subject of patch 0001 to correct a nit pointed out by Luc

Changes since v12:
- Rebased onto v4.16-rc6
- Split patch 0001 into two and reworked the commit log as requested
  by Luc Van Oostenryck

Changes since v11:
- Rebased onto v4.16-rc5
- Added a patch (0001) to fix some old and new sparse warnings
  that the kbuild robot warned about this cycle. The latest version
  of sparse was required to reproduce these.
- Added a patch (0002) to add io{read|write}64 to parisc which the kbuild
  robot also found errors for this cycle

Changes since v10:
- Rebased onto v4.16-rc4, this droped the drm/tilcdc patch which was
  picked up by that tree and is already in 4.16.

Changes since v9:
- Rebased onto v4.15-rc6
- Fixed a couple of issues in the new version of the CAAM patch as
  pointed out by Horia

Changes since v8:
- Rebased onto v4.15-rc2, as a result rewrote patch 7 seeing someone did
  some similar cleanup in that area.
- Added a patch to clean up the Switchtec NTB driver which landed in
  v4.15-rc1

Changes since v7:
- Fix minor nits from Andy Shevchenko
- Rebased onto v4.14-rc1

Changes since v6:
 ** none **

Changes since v5:
- Added a fix to the tilcdc driver to ensure it doesn't use the
  non-atomic operation. (This includes adding io{read|write}64[be]_is_nonatomic
  defines).

Changes since v4:
- Add functions so the powerpc implementation of iomap.c compiles. (As
  noticed by Horia)

Changes since v3:

- I noticed powerpc didn't use the appropriate functions seeing
  readq/writeq were not defined when iomap.h was included. Thus I've
  included a patch to adjust this
- Fixed some mistakes with a couple of the defines in io-64-nonatomic*
  headers
- Fixed a typo noticed by Horia.

(earlier versions were drastically different)


Logan Gunthorpe (7):
  iomap: Use non-raw io functions for io{read|write}XXbe
  parisc: iomap: introduce io{read|write}64
  iomap: introduce io{read|write}64_{lo_hi|hi_lo}
  io-64-nonatomic: add io{read|write}64[be]{_lo_hi|_hi_lo} macros
  ntb: ntb_hw_intel: use io-64-nonatomic instead of in-driver hacks
  crypto: caam: cleanup CONFIG_64BIT ifdefs when using io{read|write}64
  ntb: ntb_hw_switchtec: Cleanup 64bit IO defines to use the common
    header
