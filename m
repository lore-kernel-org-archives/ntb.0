Yeah fair enough.

What's the plan for getting it merged? Seems we don't have one?

Given it touches two arches and generic stuff and drivers and crypto,
it's a bit of a mess to merge. It's not really something I want to merge
via the powerpc tree.

Is there any way to split it? I couldn't immediately see what the hard
dependencies were between the patches.

eg. It looks like I could take the two powerpc patches on their own for
4.17, and then the rest could go via other trees?

Is patch 1 stand alone?

The other option is to ask Andrew Morton to take it, as he often carries
these cross-tree type series.

cheers
