Thanks!

I'll try to get the rebase done and all the feedback so far applied by
the end of the week and resend a v1.

I was thinking #2 was the best choice as well but really it's for you
maintainers to decide. And, yes, we'd want to get Bjorn's ack.

This looks like a false positive to me. The code looks correct. smatch
may have been confused by the fact that the lock is taken by two calls
to the static function 'lock_mutex_and_test_alive'.

This is also part of the switchtec management driver that's already in
the kernel and not part of the NTB related patches I sent.
