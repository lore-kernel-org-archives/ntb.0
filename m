Okay

Not okay.

Some drivers (hardware) would like to have non-atomic MMIO accesses
when readq() defined

> 3) The arch has ioread64 defined so the atomic operation is used.

Not okay. Same reason as above.

In case of readq() / writeq() it's defined by the order of inclusion:

1)
include <...non-atomic...>
include <linux/io.h>

Always non-atomic will be used.

2)
include <linux/io.h>
include <...non-atomic...>

Auto switch like you described.

I don't like above solution, since it's fragile, but few drivers depend on that.

If you wish to do it always like 2) perhaps we need to split accessors
to ones for fixed bus width and ones for atomic/non-atomic cases.
OTOH, it would be done by introducing
memcpyXX_fromio()
memcpyXX_toio()
memsetXX_io()

Where XX = 64, 32, 16, 8.

Note, that ioreadXX_rep() is not the same as above.

P.S. I have done a table of comparison between IO accessors in Linux
kernel and it looks hell out of being consistent.
