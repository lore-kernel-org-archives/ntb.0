Hi,

Presently, the 64bit IO functions are not very usable in drivers because
they are not universally available in all architectures. This leads to
a bunch of hacks in the kernel to work around this. (See the last 3
patches in this series.) As part of my switchtec_ntb submission which
added another one of these warts, Greg asked me to look into fixing
it[1].

So this patchset attempts to solve this issue by filling in the missing
implementations in iomap.c and io.h. After that, the alpha architecture is
the only one I found that also needed a fix for this. Finally, this
patchset removes the hacks that have accumulated in the kernel,
thus far, for working around this.

This set is based off of v4.12-rc6.

Thanks,

Logan
