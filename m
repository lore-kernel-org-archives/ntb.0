Not to incessantly bike shed on the naming, but I don't like cast_out,
it's not very descriptive. And it has connotations of getting rid of
something, which isn't really true.

FWIW, I like the from_ part of the original naming, as it has some clues
as to what is being done here. Why not just from_container()? That
should immediately tell people what it does without having to look up
the implementation, even before this becomes a part of the accepted
coding norm.
