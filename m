Yeah, so far there is no plan. I'm not really sure who's attention I 
need to get or how to get it.

Understood.

Yes, a couple of patches have already been taken by their maintainers 
over the last few cycles.

Yup! If you can take the powerpc patches I can keep trying to get the 
rest in. They are largely independent and shouldn't really change 
anything without the following patches.

Essentially, yes, but patch 5 depends on it seeing it's changing the 
same area and is trying to avoid creating the same kbuild warnings that 
patch 1 suppresses.

Thanks for the tip! I'll copy him when I repost it after the merge window.
