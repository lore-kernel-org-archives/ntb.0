Okay, if the main issue is that pci-epf-vntb does not raise MSI-X, even when
ntb_hw_epf host side has requested MSI-X, then I think that the first patch
in the series should fix this, so that the fix can easily be backported.

(Right now you fix this in patch 3/3, and the fix in patch 3/3 depends on
both patches 1/3 and 2/3.)

I think that pci-epf-vntb actually respecting the configured IRQ type by the
host is a separate logical change from adding support for HW defined layout.

Okay, if pci-epf-ntb is special, perhaps we should add a comment in
pci-epf-ntb which explains why it cannot support HW defined layout.

But for consistency, if we modify pci-epf-vntb, I think it would make sense
to also modify pci-epf-test and nvmet-pci-epf as well in the same series.

pci-epf-test should be easy to test, just run the pci endpoint selftest.

nvmet-pci-epf should be quite easy to test too, just run the normal fio based
testing that we usually run, and unless you see worse performance, I think we
are good. (If we see worse performance, that could be an indication that one
of the MSI-X for the different completion queues are not being correctly
triggered. By default, the host side nvme driver creates one completion queue
(and one submission queue) per host CPU.


What I suggest that you instead do something like:
Patch 1/7: pci-epf-vntb: Fix to actually use MSI-X when requested.
           This probably includes adding the code that is inside the
	   if (ret == -ENOENT) { }.
Patch 2/7: PCI: endpoint: Support hardware-owned MSI-X table and PBA
Patch 3/7: PCI: dw-rockchip: Support fixed MSI-X table and PBA on RK3588
Patch 4/7: pci-epf-vntb: Add code that calls pci_epc_get_hw_msix_layout()
           and uses that layout, if the function returned success.
Patch 5/7: pci-epf-test: Add code that calls pci_epc_get_hw_msix_layout()
           and uses that layout, if the function returned success.
Patch 6/7: nvmet-pci-epf: Add code that calls pci_epc_get_hw_msix_layout()
           and uses that layout, if the function returned success.
Patch 7/7: pci-epf-ntb: Add comment that explains why it cannot call
           pci_epc_get_hw_msix_layout() like all other EPF drivers that
	   support MSI-X.


This way, patch 1/7 can be backported, and will help all users vNTB users,
even the users that do not use RK3588 as an EPC.

Yes, since pci-epf-ntb apparently is special, I can see why you need
both ep_func->msix_hw_owned and dw_pcie_ep_msix_layout_is_hw_owned().


Kind regards,
