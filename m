I'm not sure what you mean here. The driver should use ioread64 and
include an io-64-nonatomic header. Then there are three cases:

1) The arch has no atomic 64 bit io operations defined. In this case it
uses the non-atomic inline function in the io-64-nonatomic header.

2) The arch uses CONFIG_GENERIC_IOMAP and has readq defined, but not
ioread64 defined (likely because pio can't do atomic 64 bit operations
but mmio can). In this case we need to use the ioread64_xx functions
defined in iomap.c which do atomic mmio and non-atomic pio.

3) The arch has ioread64 defined so the atomic operation is used.

I'll fix this in the next revision.

Thanks,
