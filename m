Aliases for devices that don't have a representation on the bus is only
one use for pci_add_dma_alias(), we can also use it when the aliased
device is visible on the bus and then it factors not only into the IOMMU
context entries for a given device, but also the grouping of multiple
devices that must be done without a host endpoint driver.

Sounds like a dangerous interface, imagine two physical functions on a
device, each assigned to separate guests where one guest could usurp
context entries for hidden devices from the other guest.  Thanks,
