Yes, Allen's already pointed this out. I'll be sure to fix it up before
a final submission.

I disagree completely. Practicality trumps philosophy in every case. I
need emulated scratchpads for ntb_transport to work and I'm not getting
rid of it (thus breaking things that work well) just because of your
philosophical beliefs.

Nothing in-kernel actually uses the peer's scratchpads while the link is
down and all clients seem specifically designed to wait until the link
event to set them. So I think you're either wrong about that rule or we
should change the rule going forward.

I'm not sure what you're referring to about the link stuff; as
implemented, our link management works just fine.

Yes, I expect we will get there eventually, it doesn't sound like much
work. However, it's client support that's really going to make this
interesting and worthwhile. That seems like the real challenge right now.

Seems like every time I make a submission, someone either wants patches
to be smaller and split up more or bigger and combined. I happen to
agree with the people who prefer smaller patches and I think these
provide good chunks for reviewers to look at. So, no, I'm not going to
change this. Feel free to apply the patches to a git tree or view it on
our github branch if you want to see the code combined.

Thanks,

Logan
