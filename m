I might massage this a little further, something like:

  This helper encodes an 8-bit devfn as a bit number in dma_alias_mask,
  which is used to program permissible BDF source addresses for DMA
  requests in the IOMMU.  These aliases factor into IOMMU group
  creation and are useful for devices generating DMA requests beyond or
  different from their logical bus devfn.  Examples include device
  quirks where the device simply uses the wrong devfn, as well as
  non-transparent bridges where the alias may be a proxy for devices in
  another domain.

  IOMMU group creation is performed during device discovery or
  addition, prior to any potential DMA mapping and therefore prior to
  driver probing, particularly for userspace assigned devices where
  IOMMU group definition cannot be left as a userspace activity.  DMA
  aliases should therefore be configured via quirks, such as the PCI
  fixup header quirk.

Thanks,
Alex
