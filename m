You'd have to first figure out whether this device is of the lo-hi
or the hi-lo variant, or doesn't allow the I/O to be split at all.

Note that we could theoretically define ARM to use strd/ldrd
for writeq/readq, but I would expect that to be wrong with many
other devices that can use the existing io-64-nonatomic headers.

The comment in set_scanout() suggests that we actually do rely
on the write64 to be atomic, so we probably don't want to change
this driver.
