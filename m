Actual problem is the design of your driver. Of course you can disagree as much as
you want.

This doesn't prove your way of splitting patchset is correct, but supports
my point. As well as the sentence about the logical sentence in addition
to the thing about easy review.

And your quotation doesn't prove you are right. Greg asked you to split at
least the documentation. He had point to ask it, since it's logically correct.
You wasn't arguing with him, was you? But in this case you have sent the
set of incremental patches of your own code, so I don't see how it can be
easier for review, than a combined text.

I don't want to review a patchset, which isn't properly formated.
