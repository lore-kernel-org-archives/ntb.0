This (and Alex's) analysis is very useful and I'd like to capture it
somehow, perhaps by expanding the poor pci_add_dma_alias() function
comment I added with f0af9593372a ("PCI: Add pci_add_dma_alias() to
abstract implementation").

The admonition to "call early" without any details about *how* early
or *why* it needs to be called early is not really very useful.

If we added your analysis, it would be a great help to anybody who
reworks IOMMU groups in the future.
