Right. What I'm suggesting is a clear cut between the current approach,
which obviously needs to be preserved, and a consistent new approach
which handles MSI, MSI-X and IMS in the exactly same way.

The availability of IR remapping where the irqdomain which is provided
by the remapping unit signals that it supports this new scheme:

                    |--IO/APIC
                    |--MSI
     vector -- IR --|--MSI-X
                    |--IMS

while the current scheme is:

                    |--IO/APIC
     vector -- IR --|--PCI/MSI[-X]

or 

                    |--IO/APIC
     vector --------|--PCI/MSI[-X]

So in the new scheme the IR domain will advertise new features which are
not available on older kernels. The availability of these new features
is the indicator for the interrupt subsystem and subsequently for PCI
whether IMS is supported or not.

Bootup either finds an IR unit or not. In the bare metal case that's the
usual hardware/firmware detection. In the guest case it's the
availability of vIR including the required hypercall protocol.

So for the guest case the initialization would look like this:

   qemu starts guest
      Method of interrupt management defaults to current scheme
      restricted to MSI/MSI-X

      guest initializes
          older guest do not check for the hypercall so everything
          continues as of today

          new guest initializes vIR, detects hypercall and requests
          from the hypervisor to switch over to the new scheme.

          The hypervisor grants or rejects the request, i.e. either both
          switch to the new scheme or stay with the old one.

The new scheme means, that all variants, MSI, MSI-X, IMS are handled in
the same way. Staying on the old scheme means that IMS is not available
to the guest.

Having that clear separation is in my opinion way better than trying to
make all of that a big maze of conditionals.

I'm going to make that clear cut in the PCI/MSI management layer as
well. Trying to do that hybrid we do today for irqdomain and non
irqdomain based backends is just not feasible. The decision which way to
go will be very close to the driver exposed API, i.e.:

   pci_alloc_ims_vector()
        if (new_scheme())
        	return new_scheme_alloc_ims();
        else
        	return -ENOTSUPP;

and new_scheme_alloc_ims() will have:

   new_scheme_alloc_ims()
        if (!system_supports_ims())
        	return -ENOTSUPP;
        ....

system_supports_ims() makes its decision based on the feature flags
exposed by the underlying base MSI irqdomain, i.e. either vector or IR
on x86.

Vector domain will not have that feature flag set, but IR will have on
bare metal and eventually in the guest when the vIR setup and hypercall
detection and negotiation succeeds.

IR has the following information available:

   Interrupt type
    - MSI:   Device, index and number of vectors
    - MSI-X: Device, index
    - IMS:   Device, index

  Target APIC/vector pair

IMS: The index depends on the storage type:

     For storage in device memory, e.g. IDXD, it's the array index.

     For storage in system memory, the index is a software artifact.

Does that answer your question?
