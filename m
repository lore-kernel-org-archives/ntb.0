It's the way the NTB API was created for, to have set of functions to access
NTB devices in the similar way. These aren't my beliefs, it's the way it was
created. I agree it can be optional, but it shouldn't be made as the basics
of the driver. It is called NTB "hardware" driver after all, not "emulating" or
"abstracting" driver.
ntb_transport could work without Scratchpads, if it's properly altered to
use NTB messaging. This should be the way to make things compatible, but not
making the hardware driver suitable for just one ntb_transport.

It's not like my whim or something, but the way it's usually done.
https://kernelnewbies.org/PatchPhilosophy

Cite from there:
"Each patch should group changes into a logical sequence. Bug fixes must
come first in the patchset, then new features. This is because we need to be
able to backport bug fixes to older kernels, and they should not depend on
new features."

You grouped the patches in according to your logical view or development
progress (I don't know for sure), but it's not obvious for reviewers.
From my perspective your new Microsemi Switchtec NTB driver is just one
feature. I don't know who would think differently so to split the solid
driver up for review. Switchtec management driver alteration might be the
same - just one fix. It's much easier for you to have your commits squashed,
than for me to look at your git tree, than get back to your patchset looking
for a necessary peace of patch and commenting it there.
