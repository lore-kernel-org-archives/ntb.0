Hi Niklas, Max,

If the normal GIC/ITS-based doorbell is usable, I do not see any advantage in
selecting the embedded/eDMA backend explicitly. That is why the embedded backend
is not exposed as a selectable backend and is tried only as a hidden fallback
since v5, after the v4 discussion:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/avey4i3lwcqt4wsy3y2wjlx7ixo7sqe64hngj2ne6vubl4mjzv@kaksbjkspifd/

The current DWC eDMA interrupt-emulation backend does not provide multiple
independent doorbells. The aux-resource currently exposes one MMIO doorbell
target, one write value and one Linux IRQ. If the caller requests multiple
doorbells, pci_epf_alloc_doorbell() just replicates the same address/data/IRQ,
and consumers have to treat them as shared "kick" doorbells.

Note that the per-channel status fields in DMA_{WRITE,READ}_INT_STATUS_OFF do
not provide a separate doorbell vector slot either. They are real DMA interrupt
status bits. The interrupt-emulation feature only relies on the fact that a
write to the INT_STATUS register address triggeres a local interrupt, while it
does not set the Done/Abort status bits for that emulated interrupt. Therefore,
the write data is not usable to distinguish doorbell vectors.

So, from the vector-granularity point of view, the embedded/eDMA fallback is not
better than the GIC ITS path at all. Actually, it is more limited: the GIC ITS
path distinguishes vectors by MSI data, while the current embedded/eDMA backend
does not expose per-vector distinguishable address/data pairs.

Also, address-wise, both the GIC ITS-backed backend and the eDMA interrupt
emulation backend are effectively single-target-address backends. Therefore I do
not think the eDMA fallback has a generic advantage for alignment requirements
either.

Just a minor clarification: for case a), pci_epf_alloc_doorbell() still returns
the doorbell info, but the EPF does not need to program another IB iATU for the
doorbell. It can just reuse the pre-exposed BAR/offset.

IIRC, on RK3588, adding an IB iATU region that maps the eDMA register block to
e.g. BAR0 seemed to break the original fixed BAR4 mapping too (i.e. the host
side no longer be able to use the register block properly even via BAR4). That
looked to me the most difficult issue, and I still have no clue why so.

On Renesas R-Car S4, where no fixed mapping seemed to be present [1], I confirmed
that we can expose the eDMA register block at a BAR/offset chosen by the EPF,
within the usual IB iATU granularity/region constraints, by manually programming
an IB iATU.

[1]: while RK3588 looks as if it has something like:
  ENABLE_MEM_MAP_UNROLL_DMA_REG = 1
  MEM_FUNC0_BAR4_TARGET_MAP = TRGT0
  UNROLL_BAR_NUM  = 4
  UNROLL_DMA_OFFSET_BAR = 0x0000
  UNROLL_ATU_OFFSET_BAR = 0x2000
R-Car S4 does not seem to have such an arrangement.

AFAIK, GIC ITS does not allocate different target addresses for each vector.
The MSI target address is the GITS_TRANSLATER address, or an IOVA for it, and
different vectors are distinguished by the MSI data rather than by different
target addresses.

So address-wise, the current GIC ITS backend and the current embedded/eDMA
backend are not very different: neither backend allocates a fresh arbitrary
target address for each vector. The difference is that the GIC ITS backend has
per-vector MSI data, while the current embedded/eDMA backend exposes only one
address/data/IRQ tuple.

I also think the alignment requirement is somewhat orthogonal to whether the
backend address is single or fixed. I am not sure that adding only an "align"
parameter to pci_epf_alloc_doorbell() would be very useful. With the current
API, how the returned doorbell is exposed in a BAR, including any IB iATU
subrange mapping, is up to the caller, and the caller can already look at
pci_epc_features::align when setting up that mapping.

For future users with some fixed layout requirements, I agree it may be more
useful to let the caller express the required BAR offset/window or other layout
constraints, so that only the backend that satisfies the constraint is chosen
and allocated.

Best regards,
Koichiro
