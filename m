Well, clients not checking the error code made this harder to debug for
sure, but removing the error code is a side effect and not what is
happening here (in fact someone should probably still go back and add
error checking because these functions can still return errors but
that's not really something I have time to do). After the next couple
patches, the clients will use this change to detect that there are no
port numbers and handle things similarly to the way they did before they
were broken by the multiport changes.

This is the opposite of what I've ever heard before. Having a commit
message that explains what led up to this commit is a good thing and
allows people debugging in the future to better understand the decisions
made. People debugging commits will never find the 0/X cover letter
which is just intended to introduce the series to reviewers and describe
changes if the series is posted multiple times.

No this is not a feature request. This is fixing a regression that broke
previously working code in the only sensible way I can come up with. If
you have a better way to fix this, I'd be glad to hear it. But this
should *not* be treated as a feature request.
