Oy, yes that was more than a year ago.

Hmm, well in fairness that commit didn't add any BE operations so
lower/higher address is the same as lower/higher data being written.
hi-lo/lo-hi is a bit ambiguous in that sense and designing it to match
the semantics of the only user seemed to make sense at the time. I
didn't even check the rough comments in an old commit message which I
wouldn't really take as canonical. Also, it seems to me, most hardware
would expect you to write in order of the address (if it cares at all)
not in the order of the higher/lower data word. Though, I have no
explicit examples only a gut feeling.

Yes, though IMO, I think the patch I sent earlier is clearer than the
current code with the nested ifs in different static functions. In any
case, I'll drop it and let you make any changes you see fit.
